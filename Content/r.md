## Date Formats

**Date Formats in R** [[Website](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2013/08/date-formats-in-r/)]
* Conversions to call a date in various ways.
  * Example: %a &rarr; abbreviated weekday &rarr; Sun, Thu

**Lubridate** [[Website](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html)]
* Lubridate makes it easier to do the things R does with date-times and possible to do the things R does not. Converting date-times, formatting dates, etc.
 
## ggplot2

**ggplot2 Colors** [[Website](https://sape.inf.usi.ch/quick-reference/ggplot2/colour)]
* Color names and visuals for all colors in ggplot2.

### Forecasting

**Forecasting: Principles and Practice 3rd Edition** by Rob J Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos [[Online Textbook](https://otexts.com/fpp3/)] 
* Focuses on forecasting using different models and visualizations in R. Dives deep into each model, with explanations as to what they are, when to use them, etc.
* Includes an intro to what forecasting is, case studies, exercises, and more.
* It's dense enough to provide enough information to aid in forecasting, but not too much where the reader gets lost in the text.

### PCA

**Making Sense of Principal Component Analysis** [[Website](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/2691/making-sense-of-principal-component-analysis-eigenvectors-eigenvalues/140579#140579)]
* Simple breakdown and explanation of what PCA is and why it's used.

## Quatro

Quatro files (.qmd) are used to render R code and visuals to create HTML, PDF, and other files so others can read it.
